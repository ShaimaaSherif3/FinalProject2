- *Python* (Data Processing & Machine Learning)
- *Pandas & NumPy* (Data Handling)
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* (Data Visualization)
- *Scikit-Learn* (Machine Learning)
- *FPDF* (Report Generation)

## ðŸ“Š Data Processing Steps
1. *Load & Clean Data*: Remove missing values and standardize numerical features.
2. *Apply K-Means Clustering*: Divide customers into distinct groups.
3. *Visualize Results*: Use scatter plots to analyze customer clusters.
4. *Generate Report*: Save insights as a *PDF report*.
